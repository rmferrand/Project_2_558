# ST558 Project 2 - Data Exploration

## Purpose

This Shiny app was created to fulfill the requirements for Project 2 in ST558, a Master of Statistics Course at North Carolina State University. The project focuses on the integration of functions, data analysis, and the development of Shiny applications. The Shiny application allows users to interactively explore a datset, by means of subsetting, downloading, and variable analysis.

## Author

Robert (Robbie) Ferrand created this applet. As a former phone addict, he found interest and motivation in exploring this data. He is a student in the MS Statistics program, graduating FA2024. His primary interests are data analytics, data science, and teaching.

## About the Data

The data (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset>) is a dataset containing 700 observations, with the topic of interest being mobile user behavior. The dataset categories users into 1 of 5 usage categories, from least extreme to most extreme based on various numerical variables (such as app usage, data usage, etc.). Users are also categorized by variables such as age, gender, etc.

## Data Subsetting and Exploration

The sidebar layout allows the user to subset the data at any point. Users may select from any specific categorical variable and the various possible levels. The users may also select from a few numeric variables, and use the sliders to change the range of the data as they best see fit. The about tab, which you are reading now, is intended to outline the purpose and function of the Shiny app. the Data Download tab allows users to download the data for personal use, including subsetted and unsubsetted data. Finally, the data explore tab allows the user to run through numerical, categorical, and graphical analysis of the data.
